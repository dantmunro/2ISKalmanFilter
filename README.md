# 2ISKalmanFilter
An implementation of the following Machine Learning Algorithms in Allegro Common Lisp: 
1. Kalman Filter
2. Kalman Smoother
3. LDS Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

The project is frequently abbreviated as "Kalman Filter" or "kf", though the Kalman Filter is in fact one part
of the Latent Linear Dynamical System which this project actually implements.

Required tools:
1. Allegro Common Lisp (by Franz, Inc.)
2. Python 2.7 with Matplotlib

To execute, open the "kf-portfolio.lpr" file which will run the Kalman Filter automatically.
Then run the "plotKalmanFilterEffects.py" to plot the results
